## 🌟 Overview

MentalHealthJournal is a modern Android application designed to support mental well-being by providing an easy-to-use platform for daily journaling, mood tracking, and self-reflection. Built entirely in Kotlin with a focus on privacy, analytics, and elegant UI/UX, this project demonstrates full-stack Android development skills, clean architecture, and a passion for meaningful technology.

**Why I built this:**  
Maintaining mental health is as important as physical health. I wanted to create a secure, user-friendly app that empowers individuals to reflect, recognize patterns, and grow. This project also showcases my skills in Android development, UI design, local data management, and data visualization.
